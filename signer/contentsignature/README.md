# Content Signature

## Rationale

As we rapidly increase the number of services that send configuration
data to Firefox agents, we also increase the probability of a service
being compromised to serve fraudulent data to our users. Content
Signature implements a signing protocol to protect the information sent
from backend services to Firefox user-agents.

Content signature adds a layer to TLS and certificate pinning. As we
grow our service infrastructure, the risk of a vulnerability on our
public endpoints increases, and an attacker could exploit a
vulnerability to serve bad data from trusted sites directly. TLS with
certificate pinning prevents bad actors from creating fraudulent Firefox
services, but does not reduce the impact a break-in would have on our
users. Content signature provides this extra layer.

Finally, content signature helps us use Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
without worrying that a compromise would end-up serving bad data to our
users. Signing content at the source reduces pressure on the
infrastructure and allows us to rely on vendors without worrying about
data integrity.

## Signature

Content signatures are computed on data and served to Firefox either via
a HTTP response header or through a separate signature field in the data
being transported.

Content signature have three main components: a signature mode
(**mode**), an ecdsa signature encoded with Base64 URL (**signature**)
and the URL to a chain of certificates that link to a trusted root
(**x5u**). The example below shows the JSON representation of a content
signature:

``` json
{
  "mode": "p384ecdsa",
  "signature": "gZimwQAsuCj_JcgxrIjw1wzON8WYN9YKp3I5I9NmOgnGLOJJwHDxjOA2QEnzN7bXBGWFgn8HJ7fGRYxBy1SHiDMiF8VX7V49KkanO9MO-RRN1AyC9xmghuEcF4ndhQaI",
  "x5u": "https://foo.example.com/chains/certificates.pem"
}
```

-   **mode** is a suite of algorithms used to issue the signature.
    Autograph uses three modes:
    -   **p384ecdsa** is the default used by firefox. It calculates
        signatures on the P-384 NIST curve and uses SHA2-384 for hashes.
    -   **p256ecdsa** uses the P-256 NIST curve and SHA256 for hashes
    -   **p521ecdsa** uses the P-521 NIST curve and SHA512 for hashes
-   **signature** contains the base64_url of the signature, computed
    using an elliptic curve and a hash algorithm that depends on the
    mode. The signature is issued by the private key of the end-entity
    cert referenced in the X5U. The decoded base64 contains a binary
    string that is a DL/ECSSA representation of the R and S values (IEEE
    Std 1363-2000). This format concatenates R and S into a single
    value. To retrieve R and S, split the decoded base64 in the middle,
    and take R on the left and S on the right.
-   **x5u** contains the location of the chain of trust that issued the
    signature. This file contains at least two certificates encoded in
    PEM format, where the first certificate is the end-entity that
    issued the signature, and the last certificate is the root of the
    PKI. Firefox is configured to only accept signatures from the
    internal PKI shared with AMO.

When Firefox verifies a content signature, it first retrieves the X5U
and checks the signature validity using the end-entity certificate, the
signature, and the content being protected. Firefox then verifies the
chain of trust of the end-entity links to a root cert with a hash
matching the one in Firefox. Finally, to prevent application A from
signing content for application B, Firefox verifies the subject
alternate name of the end-entity certificate matches the one it expects.
This is hardcoded for each component that uses content signature.
Onecrl, for example, uses the namespace
`onecrl.content-signature.mozilla.org` and only end-entity
certificates that have this subject alternate name can issue signatures
for the OneCRL service.

## Configuration

The type of this signer is **contentsignature**.

Configuring an Autograph signer to issue content signature requires
providing the private ECDSA key and the X5U value to be used in
signatures.

> Each signer is composed of an identifier and an ECDSA private key on
> the P-384 NIST curve. To generate a key pair with openssl, use:

``` bash
$ openssl ecparam -name secp384r1 -genkey
-----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----
BgUrgQQAIg==
-----END EC PARAMETERS-----
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
MIGkAgEBBDAGajHPaAY9gliN0RzSlByVXZa4jyruijtIFXmuSPHlZxLegbiqGmJh
NCdu65eF4UagBwYFK4EEACKhZANiAAQDN4noWrHubA8gsigJM/AwY1yO1NmjuKnc
3ZT32OE2/nk9UMsIYE8LwGEMikGXAUd3XVkJh6wJybVekcjz9khNDAos/EnoiJ96
ZosSXJrWEeyFmlp8GvDlOoZqd7xpW08=
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
```

The output from OpenSSL must be copied under the
`privatekey` section of the signer, as follows:

``` yaml
signers:
- id: appkey1
  type: contentsignature
  privatekey: |
      -----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----
      BgUrgQQAIg==
      -----END EC PARAMETERS-----
      -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
      MIGkAgEBBDART/nn3fKlhyENdc2u3klbvRJ5+odP0kWzt9p+v5hDyggbtVA4M1Mb
      fL9KoaiAAv2gBwYFK4EEACKhZANiAATugz97A6HPqq0fJCGom9PdKJ58Y9aobARQ
      BkZWS5IjC+15Uqt3yOcCMdjIJpikiD1WjXRaeFe+b3ovcoBs4ToLK7d8y0qFlkgx
      /5Cp6z37rpp781N4haUOIauM14P4KUw=
      -----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Based on the `privatekey`, autograph will return the
corresponding `publickey` in the JSON responses. If you\'re
using a PKI and want to verify signatures with a X.509 certificate, you
can generate this certificate based on the private key, store it
someplace, and tell autograph to return its location in the
`x5u` value.

``` bash
# first make a CSR based on the private key
$ openssl req -new -key /tmp/autograph-dev.key -out /tmp/autograph-dev.csr

# then self sign the CSR
$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in /tmp/autograph-dev.csr -signkey /tmp/autograph-dev.key -out /tmp/autograph-dev.crt
```

Store the CRT on
`http://example.net/certs/autograph-dev.crt` and set the x5u
value in `autograph.yaml`.

``` yaml
signers:
- id: appkey2
  x5u: "http://example.net/certs/autograph-dev.crt"
  type: contentsignature
  privatekey: |
      -----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----
      .....
```

## Signature requests

This signer support both the `/sign/data` and
`/sign/hash` endpoints. When signing data, the base64 of the
data being signed must be passed in the `input` field of the
JSON signing request. When signing hashes, the `input` field
must contain the base64 of the hash being signed.

``` json
[
    {
        "input": "Y2FyaWJvdW1hdXJpY2UK",
        "keyid": "some_content_signer"
    }
]
```

This signer doesn\'t support any option.
